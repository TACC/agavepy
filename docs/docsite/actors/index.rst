Agave actors are based off the 
`actor model <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model>`_.
Actors are meant to respond to messages from the user or from thrid-party
applications and act in the user's interest be it by creating other actors,
running Agave applications, moving data, etc.

For more info on how actors are implemented see
